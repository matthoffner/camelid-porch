With camelid-porch you can load data into an Alpaca or Llama large language model using llama-index and langchain. For example, you can load a directory of text files, or a file of urls.  Commands are available to save or prompt afterwards. Because llama-index supports creating a custom LLM, no API keys are required. I've also included a script for experimenting with BabyAGI, I would expect this tooling to improve quickly so this is primarily a research repo.
